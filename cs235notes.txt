      Graph -> Tree -> Binary Tree (BT) -> Binary Search Tree (BST)
        Graph - Nodes and edges, can have cycles, can have isolated nodes/clusters, can be undirected or directed
        Tree - A graph where all nodes have exactly one parent (except the root node, which has 0), no cycles, connected, finite
        Binary Tree - A tree where all nodes have at most two children
        Binary Search Tree - A binary tree where all nodes with smaller values than a node are in its left subtree and nodes with larger values are in its right subtree (ordered tree)
      Depth/height
        Depth - Root has depth of 1, add 1 for each generation down
        Height - Leaf nodes have height of 1. For a node with children, take the height of its tallest child and add 1.
      Traversals
        Preorder - Visit, Traverse Left, Traverse Right
        Inorder - Traverse Left, Visit, Traverse Right
        Postorder - Traverse Left, Traverse Right, Visit
        Breadth-first - Visit all nodes with a depth of 1, then all with depth of 2 from left to right, continue pattern until all nodes visited

    Canvas Grades
      Blank scores for everything up through the midterm have now been replaced with 0, so your grade should be more accurate
      Anyone who failed to turn in a lab verification got a 0 on the verfication AND the lab itself (see syllabus)
      Remember late policy - 10% off per day late, up to 40% off (so labs 1-4 can still be submitted for 60% credit)
      Please contact me to resolve any issues or concerns
    Midterm - After careful deliberation, I decided to give 1/2 credit to those who reversed the stack order on the postfix evaluation question (5/7 instead of 3/7)
